          <p>Welcome to our website about Co2!</p>
          <p>Co2 is more important than it has ever been, therefore we thought it would be important to show the people how it already affects us.</p>
          <p>Also, we will show some statistics and some research.</p>
          <p>Additionaly, we will show some possible solutions. These can be things that you can change or the state you live in could change</p>
          <p>In the end, we will introduce you to app. With the app, you can calculate the approximate amount of Co2 that you use on a daily base</p>
          <p> At the Navigation-bar above, you can visit the different sectors of our website</p>
